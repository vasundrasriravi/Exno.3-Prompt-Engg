### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222230168
## Aim:
To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists users in managing stress, anxiety, and emotional well-being. The chatbot should handle various mental health concerns in a friendly and non-judgmental manner, using multiple prompting techniques to guide its responses.

## Algorithm:  
## 1. Direct Instruction Prompting
### Prompt:
"If a user says 'I feel sad,' respond with: 'I'm here for you. Would you like to talk about what's making you feel this way?'"
### Objective:
To provide supportive replies using a simple instruction.

## 2. Contextual Prompting
### Prompt:
"If the user previously said they feel overwhelmed with work, respond: 'You mentioned feeling overwhelmed. Would you like help finding ways to manage your workload?'"
### Objective:
To respond with context-aware support.

## 3. Persona-Based Prompting
### Prompt:
"Act like a calm and caring friend. Speak gently and encourage the user to express themselves openly."
### Objective:
To create a friendly and emotionally safe interaction.

## 4. Few-Shot Prompting
### Prompt:
Examples:
Q: "I'm anxious before exams." → A: "It's okay to feel nervous. Let’s try some breathing exercises."
Q: "I can’t sleep lately." → A: "Sleep issues can be stressful. Would you like some tips to relax before bed?"
Now respond to: "I’m feeling really isolated."
### Objective:
To help the model generalize based on prior examples.

## 5. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
### Prompt:
"When a user feels anxious, first ask what’s bothering them, then suggest a breathing exercise, and finally recommend talking to a trusted person or seeking professional help."
### Objective:
To guide complex responses in small steps.

## 6.  Instruction with Constraints
### Prompt:
"Respond in less than 30 words. Use gentle, encouraging language. Avoid clinical terms. For example: 'You're not alone. I’m here to talk anytime.'"
### Objective:
To keep replies short and emotionally safe.

## 7. Reflective Prompting
### Prompt:
"When the user says 'I’m tired of everything,' reflect: 'You're feeling exhausted and worn out, is that right? Let's talk more about what's been draining you.'"
### Objective:
To show empathy and ensure understanding.

# Result: 
All prompting techniques were implemented successfully. The chatbot responded to emotional input with empathy, context-awareness, clarity, and a calming tone. Each method contributed to building a well-rounded and supportive mental health AI assistant.
